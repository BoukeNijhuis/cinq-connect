As you went on a surprise trip organized by one of your friends you don't actually know where you ended up, but they said it would be great. After chatting with the local for a while you become rather confused. They said they are 120 years old. They seemed very knowledgeable, but 120 years old?! When you tell them your age they tell you they donÂ´t use a decimal system, but a quinary system. In other words the only numbers they know are 0 1 2 3 and 4. What you consider a 7 is a 12 for them and their 21 translates to 11 for you. Now how old was this friendly local in the decimal system?"

Multiplying 3 and 5 yields 15, so the final answer is 3 + 5 = 8<br /><br />Possible hints:<br />- The answer only has one valid combination, so the integers you are after are prime numbers -> Maybe use a list of prime numbers?<br />- Both integers are over 500, leaving a range of 500 to about 8000, instead of 3 - 1.300.000<br />"
